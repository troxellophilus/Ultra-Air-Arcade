           <h4>Technology name</h4>
	   <p>Brief overview of technology in game.</p>
           <h4>Collision Detection - Riley McGovern and Zachary Weisman</h4>
	   <p>The collision detection in Ultra Air Arcade was done using hierarchical bounding spheres for the planes. The spheres are arranged into two levels: One large sphere surrounding the entire volume of the aircraft, and five smaller spheres placed on the left and right wings, tail and nose, and one in the center. To reduce computational complexity, the game would not check any of the five smaller spheres until after a collision was flagged with the large outer sphere. For the collision with the terrain, the plane's Y coordinate was checked to make sure it was not below the height of the terrain object's height based on the plane's position.</p>
           <h4>Collision Detection Response - Riley McGovern</h4>
	   <p>The collision detection response in Ultra Air Arcade contained collisions between a plane and another plane, a plane and the terrain, and a plane and a missile. The collisions between two planes were based on the positional vectors of the two planes that were colliding and  small math with quaternions would softly "bounce" them off of each other. The collisions between a plane and the terrain would send back the plane two times the normal vector of the triangle of the terrain that the plane hit. After resetting, the plane would continue using it's thrust that it had before the collision so the plane would not get too far behind the opponents. The collisions between a missile and a plane would cause the targeted plane to lose half of it's thrust, so that the player could catch up.</p>
           <h4>Sound - Riley McGovern</h4>
	   <p>The sound in Ultra Air Arcade was run through a third party library called SFML. The library was wrapped in a custom class for use within the game. The sound of the plane was done by increasing and decreasing the pitch based on whether the player was speeding up or slowing down. Both the main theme song and race song were played on a loop. Collisions with the terrain and other planes were played in short snippets when those collisions occurred. The main countdown was done by counting down frames and playing the sound after a certain number of frames had passed. All sound was used from royalty-free sound libraries that are listed below for reference.</p>
           <h4>Skybox - Zachary Weisman</h4>
	   <p>A simple cube map was implemented, and an array of textures were loaded onto it. A special GLSL datatype - samplerCube - handled the fetching of the correct texel depending on what the camera was facing, thus making implementation relatively simple. The position of the skybox was locked to the players x - z coordinate, but was given a y - position of zero in order to keep an accurate sense of height as the player travels up and down.</p>
           <h4>Shadows - Zachary Weisman</h4>
	   <p>Shadows in our game were implemented using the shadow mapping technique. Using shadow maps, the scene is rendered twice using two separate sets of shaders. The first pass simply writes the depth value per pixel of the scene from the light-sources perspective to a framebuffer object; this is called a depth map. Then, on the CPU, that depth map is transformed to fit over the scene from the cameras perspective. Finally, a separate shader is run to render to the screen using the depth at each pixel to calculate a light factor, or simply a number to multiply the output color by in order to reduce its brightness, and make it appear shadowed.</p>
           <h4>Particles - Zachary Weisman</h4>
	   <p>A particle class was developed for Ultra Air Arcade that was based off of a simple billboard system. Upon initialization of a particle object, sixty variable sized billboards would be created, and upon rendering, the particles would be instanced one per frame for the first sixty frames of their lives, which makes them appear from the same position at different times. This, along with a randomness factor calculated at instantiation helps to make them move a little more naturally.</p>
